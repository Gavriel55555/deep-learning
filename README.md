# deep-learning
Our project is divided into 2 parts:

In part 1, we will classify images provided by intel. Our data contains 6 classes of images that I will classify using two different models: The first model will be the CNN model that I will build. The second model will be ResNet18, a preprepared model. I will train both of the models and compare the results.

In part 2, I will build AutoEncoder of unlabeled data for denoising images.
